cohort of paid and volunteer moderators and advisors.

## The Rules (Abbreviated)

1. Everyone will be reasonable.
2. Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
3. No one is special.
4. Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.
5. Reasonable people think about their use of these facilities, and the needs
   of others, and adjust their behavior to meet the goals of a common good.

The full Standards of Conduct is available [here](https://nerdfight.online/about/soc/).

## Reporting Issues and Reaching the Mods

If you are looking to reach the mods for any reason, e.g. service latency or
outages, emoji requests, requests to add domains to our blocklist, etc. we are
reachable on our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Tamarou/nerdfight.online/issues/new).

A few things to note:

* We probably won't respond to direct messages, there's a lot going on and it's
  easy to miss things. That's why we have a issue tracker.
* Some issues take longer than others to resolve.
