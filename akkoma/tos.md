## Terms of Service

Our full Terms of Service can be found [here](https://nerdfight.online/about/tos/).

Nerdfight Online is a production of Tamarou LLC and is maintained by them and a
cohort of paid and volunteer moderators and advisors.

## The Rules (Abbreviated)

1. Everyone will be reasonable.
2. Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
3. No one is special.
4. Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.
5. Reasonable people think about their use of these facilities, and the needs
   of others, and adjust their behavior to meet the goals of a common good.

The full Standards of Conduct is available [here](https://nerdfight.online/about/soc/).

## Reporting Issues and Reaching the Mods

If you are looking to reach the mods for any reason, e.g. service latency or
outages, emoji requests, requests to add domains to our blocklist, etc. we are
reachable on our GitHub Community Repo Issue Tracker.

A few things to note:

* We probably won't respond to direct [at]s, there's a lot going on and it's
  easy to miss things. That's why we have a issue tracker.
* Note that some issues take longer than others to resolve. Simpler issues like
  "please add this emoji" are easier to resolve than "can we disuss the
  moderation guidelines"

## Donations

In order to maintain a high level of support this will eventually be a paid
subscription service. When that happens depends strongly on a cacophony of
different things, the number of users, how much development time is required,
and even how much revenue Tamarou LLC gets through other sources.

Currently we have no way of taking your money, which is probably why we're
still invite only.
