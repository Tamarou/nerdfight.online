Nerdfight Online is a ActivityPub server that embraces
[Kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe) and Animated Gifs, with a
weekly accounting of who the "best" accounts are based on the actions of our
members.

This isn't any less real than Professional Wrestling.

Nerdfight Online is also a production of Tamarou LLC and is maintained by them
and a cohort of paid and volunteer moderators and advisors.
