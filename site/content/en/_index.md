It started on twitter. As Patrick [explained there](https://twitter.com/fitzgepn/status/1297712297595400192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw):

> [@JacobyDave](https://twitter.com/JacobyDave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) has written about his [#ff](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ff?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) script and the curious phenomena of [#fakeNerdFightFriday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/fakeNerdFightFriday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) that sprang up from it [here](https://jacoby.github.io/2019/07/05/the-social-experiment-of-followfriday.html).

Nerdfight Online is a ActivityPub server that embraces
[Kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe) and Animated Gifs, with a
weekly accounting of who the "best" accounts in the FediVerse are based on the
actions of our members.

This isn't any less real than Professional Wrestling.

Nerdfight Online is also a production of Tamarou LLC and is maintained by them
and a cohort of paid and volunteer moderators and advisors.
