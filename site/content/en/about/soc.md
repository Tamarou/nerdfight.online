---

This document covers the standards of conduct expected by members of the
website, this is in addition to the [Terms of Service](/about/tos/).

## The Basics (Reasonable Person Principle)

Reasonable Person Principle is the rule which you must abide by when attending
this conference. Put differently, following the Principle is your obligation
to your fellow community members.

1. Everyone will be reasonable.
2. Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
3. No one is special.
4. It's not unreasonable to suggest you are not being reasonable.

Reasonable people think about their use of these facilities, and the needs of
others, and adjust their behavior to meet the goals of a common good for the
community, i.e., expressing what you want to say, but accepting and
accommodating the needs of others.

## The Details

Nerdfight Online is moderated by human beings, which means we rely on our
community to help us find and identify content and accounts that are not
allowed on our server.

The primary purpose for Nerdfight Online is for it's members to have fun,
network, and generally socialize. To ensure that the greatest number of people
achieve this objective we have established certain rules of conduct. By these
rules we seek only to ensure that the behavior of any one small group does not
disturb the membership as a whole, nor does it detract from the relaxed and
comfortable atmosphere of the site.

Please use the report feature to help us quickly address posts and accounts
that should be removed. The following types of content will be removed from the
public timeline, and may result in an immediate ban from Nerdfight Online:

* All forms of hate and the advocacy of hate, including but not limited to
  Racism, Sexism, Misogyny, Homophobia, Transphobia, Xenophobia, Nationalism, and
  antisemitism.
* Trolling and/or personal attacks
* Intentional misinformation
* Untagged pornography and content that depicts sex acts
* Crypto, gambling, scams, or MLMs
* Unapproved bots (for approval, please contact the admins)
* Plagiarism, including posting other people's work/photos/art without credit.

The following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in an
immediate ban:

as possible. Admins are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to
the reporter of an incident.

The Nerdfight team welcomes all parties; however, the management reserves the
right to deny or revoke, limit, or otherwise moderate the account of any
individual at any time for any reason. The Nerdfight team also reserves the
right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice and

above will apply.

### Harassment

  requested for said engagement to cease may be considered harassment, regardless
  of platform-specific privacy tools employed.

leave them alone, your business with them is done. If you continue to attempt
to have contact with those people, you may be moderated or removed from the
