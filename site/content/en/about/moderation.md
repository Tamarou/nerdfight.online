title: Moderation Guide
---

Our server is independently run and actively moderated using our
[Standards of Conduct](/about/soc/) as our primary set of guidelines. This auxiliary document
is a guide to provide transparency to our members and reference for our
moderation team. Like our Code of Conduct, it should be considered a living
document.

## Transparency

Transparency is important and valuable. In this document and in our moderation
activity we will sometimes omit certain details to avoid creating vectors for
abuse, but we will be clear and explicit about our operations whenever
possible. The Nerdfight Online organizers operate with good faith expectations
of our own community members, and we consider that a two-way street. We hope
you believe in us.

### Growing the Moderation Team

As we grow and maintain our server, we seek to expand the mod team to ensure
moderation represents our community. We especially need viewpoints outside of
what our society considers the ‚Äúdefault.‚Äù

Moderation leadership and guidance is most desired from our members in any
historically marginalized group. This includes, but is not limited to, people
who are Black, indigenous, or other people of color; women, trans, non-binary,
or queer people; disabled people. Nerdfight Online is your home, too.

With limited viewpoints, it‚Äôs easier to misinterpret or misunderstand content.
To ensure we are equipped to take the most appropriate actions, it‚Äôs important
that our moderation team includes ‚Äì or at least has access to advice from ‚Äì
more diverse viewpoints.

If you would like to be a part of our moderation team, either as an active
moderator or an advisor, please contact referee@nerdfight.online. Priority will
be given to under-represented voices.

## Moderation Goals & Priorities

All of our moderation decisions come back to these core goals:

* For our server and community to be a safe and enjoyable place on the
  internet.
* To avoid and remove accounts and behavior that would harm people on our
  server, and the servers that we federate with.
* To be good citizens of the federated Mastodon network and other compatible
  platforms.
* To be transparent and consistent with our moderation decisions and actions.
* To avoid exposing our members and our moderation team to extreme and harmful
  content, or content from known bad actors & communities that tolerate or
  promote them.
* To avoid having harmful or illegal content stored/cached on our server.

At this time we are not using any shared blocklists, which means that all
moderation-related decisions are considered and made individually. This also
means that we use the guidelines below to make sure that action can be taken
quickly when necessary.

### Further considerations

Access to an account on Nerdfight Online is a privilege, not a right.

Each member‚Äôs words and actions represent our server, online and offline. We
will always aim to protect and support the most vulnerable and marginalized.
Being a paid supporter (or not) should never influence a moderation decision.
Corporations and business accounts will be moderated ‚Äúharder‚Äù than individual
people and community organizations. Your mods and admins are human. Moderation
decisions can be nuanced and complex. Patience and consideration are expected.
Your mods will talk to people like people, and treat them with respect. We
expect the same of our members.

## How we handle moderation appeals

Moderation decisions are made by humans, which means it‚Äôs possible that we make
mistakes. If you believe an action taken on your account or server is
incorrect, please use the built in option to appeal the decision and include
details that would help us consider reversing the decision.

## How we Moderate Individual Users

1. We Read User Reports

Our first line of defense is always you, our community members. Mastodon
provides a fairly robust set of tools for reporting posts and users, so please
use them!

### Reporting fellow Nerdfight Online members

These posts will usually get our priority attention, since behavior in our
server is our top priority. If you see a fellow Nerdfight Online member doing
something that is against the code of conduct, please use that report button.

Reporting members on other servers When you report a post of a member on
another server, you are by default reporting that action to the Nerdfight
Online moderation queue. You are also given the option to forward that report
to the moderation queue of the other server.

üí° Keep in mind that users on other servers have not specifically opted into
the Code of Conduct for our server, and that we do not have control over the
actions that other moderation teams do or do not take. We DO have the ability
to decide if the user‚Äôs content/behavior merits action taken on them as an
individual, or their entire server.

2. We Skim the Federated Timeline

The federated timeline does NOT include all posts from all Mastodon servers in
existence. It DOES show all posts on all Mastodon servers that our server is
connected to, or ‚Äúfederated‚Äù with. Our server becomes connected to other
servers based on when users on our server interacts with any user on the other
server. This means that our federated timeline grows each time you follow a
user on a new server that our server wasn‚Äôt previously connected to, as well as
favorites, bookmarks, and boosts. As you might guess, this means that over
time, our federated timeline becomes impossible to read in its entirety. But
when we notice issues or opportunities to be proactive, we do.

3. We read moderation community hashtag communities

Far from a silver bullet and prone to misinformation and drama, these hashtags
can be useful tools for spotting bad behavior before it gets to our server.
This can include behavior that violates our code of conduct, or that triggers a
discussion within the moderation team about if our server should proactively
‚Äúdefederate‚Äù or block a connection to that server.

## Types of Moderation Actions

When taking action on a post or a user or server, we will use the severity of
the content/behavior along with the existence or likelihood of repeat offenses
to decide which action is taken.

Potential actions include:

* Mark as sensitive (individual post or all content from a user)

This action will be used when the content is not against our code of conduct,
but should really be behind a content warning that allows users to opt-in to it
(e.g. violence, gore, or self-harm; sexual content/nudity)

* Freeze account

This action may be used to put an account into a ‚Äútime-out‚Äù state while reports
are being reviewed. While frozen, they cannot log into their account, but their
public posts and data remain on the server.

* Limit account

This action may be used as a pre-emptive measure to suspension, where the
expectation has been set that the users changes their behavior to avoid
suspension. While limited, the user can continue posting but their posts will
only be seen by people who actively chose to follow their account, and hidden
from all local and public timelines.

* Suspend/remove account

Effectively a deletion of someone‚Äôs account. They lose their login, their posts
are no longer visible, etc. After a rentention period, all data is removed and
cannot be recovered.

### Strikes

For most actions that precede suspension, a ‚Äústrike‚Äù is issued and recorded. If
a user‚Äôs individual actions do not merit suspension, they may be suspended
after they have accumulated three strikes with lesser violations.

## How we make moderation decisions

Whether in response to reports in our moderation queue, or from any of the
other sources, our decisions on how to act are proportional in severity and
follow the progression below.

### Just talking with people (check-ins and warnings)

Whenever possible and appropriate, moderators may choose to initiate a private
conversation via direct message before taking any moderation action. Our goal
is to allow the user to acknowledge and correct their behavior, which may
include editing or removing something they posted.

This option will usually be reserved for otherwise good citizens of our server
who may be having a bad day, or acting differently than usual. If appropriate,
a warning may be issued with no actions or strikes taken.

üíõ Warnings and check-ins should be issued and received as ‚Äúconsiderations‚Äù
rather than a punitive act.

### ‚ÄúNo Action Needed‚Äù

If someone does not like a certain member or a certain kind of content, but
there is no violation our code of conduct or clear and present risk to our
members or community, we may encourage the member to mute or block the user, or
use filters to keep that content out of their feeds.

These types of reports will be marked as resolved.

### Clear Code of Conduct Violations

When there is a clear violation of our Code of Conduct, a single moderator will
use the built-in Mastodon tools to remove the content and issue a single strike
on a user‚Äôs account. That user will be notified that their content has been
removed, and given an opportunity to appeal if they think the removal was in
error.

### Unclear or Ambiguous CoC Violations

When reports are less clear, or possibly ambiguous, a minimum of two moderators
must discuss the action before it is taken. If an action is taken, notes will
be included along with the removal action so that future moderators can
understand the context for the decision. At any point, the moderators can seek
outside perspective to ensure that their understanding of content or behavior
is correct before making a moderation decision or taking action.

### Situations that require a CoC Update

Our Code of Conduct is written to provide guidelines and context for our
members and moderators, and leave some degree of judgement to both parties as
well. If a report or incident indicates a significant flaw or omission from our
Code of Conduct, any moderator or member may recommend that the CoC is amended.
If a second moderator agrees that the recommendation makes it easier for
members and moderators to make good decisions in the future, that
recommendation may be added to the CoC.

## How we moderate federated servers/instances

Server-level moderation is a unique aspect of Mastodon and federated social
networks, and provides a way for us to manage issues at a ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù level
instead of (or in addition to) user-level moderation.

Also like user-level moderation, we do not currently utilize any shared
blocklists.

## Types of Server-level Problems

Internally we maintain a list of servers that we‚Äôve taken action on and the
reasons for those actions. Broadly, these reasons include but are not limited
to:

1. Willful ‚ÄúActive‚Äù Problems

* Providing safe harbor for widespread hate speech or other similar content
  that violates our CoC
* Server leadership that encourages harmful behavior like hate speech,
  brigading, and other forms of abuse
* Illegal content that our server would cache

For these kinds of willful and active problems, a single moderator is
authorized to suspend a server, provided that they record the reason for
suspension. This allows for swift and proactive action to be taken in the most
cases.

2. Nuanced and ‚ÄúPassive‚Äù Problems

* Large servers with inadequate moderation capacity
* Unintentionally harmful moderation policies or decisions that have not yet
  been amended
* Unmoderated spam in our Federated timeline

For most passive problems, or otherwise nuanced or ambiguous violations, at
least two moderators should discuss the appropriate level of action to take
before it is taken.

## Types of Server-level Actions

Like our user-level moderation, our server-level moderation follows a
progression of actions that are proportional to the problem.

Note: When appropriate and possible, our admins may contact the admins of
another server to make them aware of a problem. If the problem is acknowledged
and addressed in reasonable time, no actions will be taken. If no action is
taken, or the warning is actively rejected, a moderator may decide to take
further actions.

### Silencing (Limiting)

When our primary goal is to limit the discovery of users and content on another
server, a moderator may choose to ‚Äúsilence‚Äù another server.

This action will not impact the visibility of content if you already follow
someone on a silenced server. This action will make it more difficult to
discover users and content on the silenced server while it is silenced.

While silenced, our server will continue to store and transmit content from the
silenced server. This is a risk we carefully manage as the content could make
us complicit in/liable for content originating on the other server, even if the
visibility of the content is limited.

### Suspending (aka. blocking or defederating)

When we want to avoid all interaction with a server, a moderator will choose to
suspend that server. This action effectively makes the remote server invisible
to all of our members, including those following accounts on the suspended
server.

Our server will no longer accept or share content from the suspended server,
and after a grace period of 30 days where the suspension could be reversed
without losing data, their content is permanently deleted from our server.

## Communicating Server-level Actions

If a server is in clear violation of our code of conduct, we will avoid
announcing the action to avoid creating vectors for abuse. The vast majority of
these actions will be unnoticeable by our members unless they actively seek out
horrible internet behavior üòÖ

When a Server-level action is likely to create a noticeable change for our
members (e.g. suspending a popular or well known server), we will do our best
to announce this action by first silencing them and announcing the silencing
with a timeline for suspension.

We do not currently publish a complete blocklist to avoid creating vectors for
abuse.
